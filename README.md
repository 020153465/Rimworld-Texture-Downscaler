# Rimworld-Texture-Downscaler
Rimworld 1.3 with it's new render system made the game exploded in VRAM usage in a weird texture duplication method.
This is a simple script that help downscale the texture image resolution to migrate the issue. Come with a simple backup feature.
It have simple UI to navigate through but don't expect much from it :x

Scripted with Pytohn 3.8 and PIL library
